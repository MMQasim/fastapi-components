# fastapi-components
Modular, reusable FastAPI components for scalable backend development.


fastapi-components is a monorepo of standalone, plug-and-play packages designed to speed up and standardize FastAPI development. Each module (e.g., auth, users, products) is independently installable and can be composed into larger applications like e-commerce platforms, SaaS backends, admin dashboards, or microservices.
